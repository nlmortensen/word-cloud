# Word Cloud

This is a script that I implemented in Python that generates a word cloud from a text file. 

The objective of this project was to generate a word cloud that shows only the most frequently used words in a given text. First, I processed the text to remove any punctuation and words that do not contain all alphabets. Then, I checked each word against a predefined list of uninteresting words (such as “the”, “and”, “it”, etc) and included only the words that did not fall into that list. Finally, I added the remaining words and their frequencies to a dictionary and generated a word cloud of the words with the highest frequencies.
